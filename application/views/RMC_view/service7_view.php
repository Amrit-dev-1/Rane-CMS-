					<p class="survey-para-se2" style="text-align: justify;"> Our building plan and approval service, offered under architectural services, is designed to streamline the complex process of obtaining building permits and approvals for both new construction and redevelopment projects. We understand that each project is unique, and the required documents vary depending on factors such as the type of permission (layout, new construction, or alterations to existing buildings) and the intended use of the building (residential, commercial, mixed-use, or industrial). Our meticulous planning encompasses not only compliance with local regulations but also a keen focus on maximizing the benefit for both developers and prospective buyers. Our team ensures that area planning is carried out meticulously, optimizing space utilization and functionality to create properties that are attractive and practical. We employ thoughtful Floor Space Index (FSI) calculation, maximizing the available floor area to its fullest potential. This results in developments that are not only legally compliant but also attractive to buyers due to their efficient design and well-planned spaces. These developments often strike a harmonious balance between aesthetics, functionality, and regulatory adherence. With our expertise, we aim to simplify the approval process and guide you through the intricate landscape of building plan compliance, whether it's for a new project or a redevelopment endeavor, creating properties that are both developer-friendly and appealing to buyers. </p>
