            </h2>

            <p>
                Welcome to Rane Management Consultant Pvt. Ltd., where precision and innovation come together to shape the future of engineering solutions. Established in 1995 under the visionary leadership of Mr. Manmohan Balkrishna Rane, our company has been dedicated to providing precise Land Survey and Land Revenue data crucial for the planning and development of projects by both private and government agencies.
                <br><br>
                Our journey began with a commitment to delivering the highest quality land survey data to support the diverse needs of our clients. Over the years, we have grown and evolved, expanding our scope of services to meet the dynamic demands of the engineering, architectural, and infrastructure sector.
                <br><br>
                In 2002, we seized the opportunity to contribute to the development of modern revenue records with the latest equipment and computerized data in Maharashtra by undertaking City Survey projects for various Corporations in the state. With meticulous precision, we successfully completed eight municipal City Survey projects, establishing our reputation as a trusted partner in modern surveying, land revenue expertise, and data acquisition. Notably, our work extended to prominent municipal corporations such as Thane Municipal Corporation, Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation, and Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation.
                <br><br>
                Building upon our expertise in topographical surveying and land revenue survey, we extended our horizons into Land Acquisition, planning, and the design of various infrastructure projects. Our dedication to excellence and attention to detail have been pivotal in shaping the landscape of infrastructure development in the region.
                <br><br>
                Notably, Maharashtra Samruddhi Mahamarg stands as a testament to our record for the fastest land acquisition for any infrastructure project in India.
                <br><br>
                As we look to the future, we recognize the ever-growing demand for cutting-edge technology solutions. In response to this evolving landscape, in 2016, we took a significant step forward by introducing Mr. Viraj Manmohan Rane as a Joint Director with modern thoughts and a forward-looking vision. Mr. Viraj Manmohan Rane, a qualified civil engineer and a licensed surveyor, brings a wealth of expertise to our team. He is also a Government-approved and IBBI registered licensed land and building valuer. Under his leadership, we established an IT cell dedicated to GIS (Geographic Information Systems) solutions and application development. This strategic move allowed us to harness the power of mapping technology and application development, meeting the emerging needs of our clients and staying at the forefront of the industry.
                <br><br>
                Currently, we are the leading experts in land surveying, land acquisition, land records management, and updating in Maharashtra, trusted by the Indian Central Railways (CR), Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO), and other esteemed government agencies. Our extensive portfolio encompasses comprehensive services, including land surveying, planning, and designing. Additionally, we specialize in liaison work for major infrastructure projects in Maharashtra.
                <br><br>
                At Rane Management Consultant Pvt. Ltd., we are committed to pushing boundaries and embracing innovation to continue providing exceptional services to our clients.
